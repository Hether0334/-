证明：一个有界数列发散的充要条件是其有至少两个收敛到不同值的子列。

Proof:

Since $\{x_{n}\}$ is bounded,there exist a $\{x_{k_{n}}\}$ that 
$$
\lim_{ n \to \infty }  x_{k_{n}} = A.
$$
Also, $\{x_{n}\}$ doesn't converge,which implies that there exist another subsequence  $\{x_{c_{n}}\}$ satisfying that for a proper $\varepsilon > 0$,we hold that
$$
 | x_{c_{n}} -A |>\varepsilon.
$$
Clearly,$\{x_{c_{n}}\}$ is also bounded and have a subsequence $\{x_{d_{n}}\}$ that 
$$
\lim_{ n \to \infty } x_{d_{n}} = B
$$
Cause $| x_{d_{n}} -A |>\varepsilon$,it's impossible for $A=B$.
