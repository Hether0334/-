Difine $\{x_{n}\}$ is bounded above,and $x_{n+1} \geq x_{n}-\frac{1}{n^2}$,we hold that $\{x_{n}\}$ coverges.

Proof:

Notice that $x_{n} \geq x_{1} -1-\frac{1}{4}-\cdots-\frac{1}{(n-1)^2} >x_{1}-\frac{\pi^2}{6}$.

So $\{x_{n}\}$ is bounded both below and above.

Consider the contrary,which means that there exist at least two convergent subsequence of $\{x_{n}\}$.

$$
\lim_{ n \to \infty } x_{k_{n}}=A ,
\\
\lim_{ n \to \infty } x_{c_{n}}=B
$$
And clearly,
$$
\lim_{ n \to \infty } x_{k_{n}}-x_{c_{n}} = 0
$$
which holds a conrtrast.
